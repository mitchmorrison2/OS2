Program 2 for Mitchell Morrison

TO RUN EACH STAGE:

Comment out the code in each other source file other than Queue.h and Queue.c.

Since there is multiple c files with a main function, unless the main in the other files are commented out there is a linking error.

Ex. Run base.c normally passing in command line args once code in stage1.c and stage2.c are commented out.

Do the same for stage1.c and stage2.c when you are trying to run them.

I have precommented out stage1.c and stage2.c for you since I expect you will run base.c first.
